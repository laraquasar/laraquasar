A Laravel + Quasar Vue Framework as main frontend, using inertia.js and vite as the main foundation

Laraquasar is a Laravel template that use Quasar Framework and utilities for your Laravel project. With Laraquasar, you can quickly and easily integrate Quasar components into your Laravel.

## Who is template for?

Starting from my favorite using laravel as a backend and also quasar as the basic component of my application. I really do not like to waste time by making 2 backend and frontend projects. if you can combine it to the two why not

I am happy to hear the philosophy of being made inertia.js
